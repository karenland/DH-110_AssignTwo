# DH-110_AssignTwo

**Introduction**

Goodreads is a popular website and phone application for book readers to write and read book reviews, create lists of books, search for authors, join book clubs and create a year-long reading goal, as well as various other book-related tasks. However, one of the main goals Goodreads has is to build a sense of community among book readers. 


The heuristic evaluation I did on Goodreads concluded with some severe concerns I had for the app. One of them being that it is difficult to create a sense of camaraderie since there is no easy way to socialize with others, another is simply the aesthetics of the application in particular is quite outdated and bare for a brand so old, and lastly, it does not seem intuitive becuase possible actions are not labelled as well as the app does not have a good recongization system in place (i.e. cannot handle typos in the search bar).

I asked the user to do 5 tasks all related to the main selling points of Goodreads and/ related to the heuristic:
<ol>
  <li>I asked the reader to create a bookshelf in hopes they would note the interface and aesthetics of the function since it is quite different from the areas of the system</li>
  <li>This task was to simply explore a page since there are some features that are present but “hidden”. Makeing some of the steps difficult to do. </li>
  <li>This task had the user use the search function which I’ve said is limiting (no typos and can’t search by genre or character name) as well as create a bookshelf. I asked the reader to create a bookshelf since this section does not follow the theme of the section (I.e. the aesthetics are off; nothing about it screams books). </li>
  <li> This task had the user revisit their review to see if it added any comments. This was to test their reaction towards the community aspect of the site.  </li>
 <li> This was the ending task so they had tolog out. The log out function takes a bit of effort to find as well as the log out itself does not match the style of the app that well. </li>

</ol>


**Methodology**

With the final project in mind, I decided to use someone on the other end of the age spectrum: a 13 year old. I thought this would help me greatly for the final object so I can learn what type of tasks are suitable for first-time users and users unfamiliar with niche sites. 

The particpant used an iPad to complete the tasks and their facial expressions were being recorded using front webcam of a laptop provided. The study was done in the bedroom in a reclining chair so that they would be as comfortable as they can be in hopes that they would feel at ease to speak outloud more. 

I constructed the survey to match how it was laid out in the assignment document:
<ol>
  
  <li>Intro/Script </li>
  <li>Consent Form </li>
  <li>Previous Goodreads App/Brand Experience questions </li>
  <li>Pre-Test Questionnaire </li>
  <li>Tasks and Scenarios </li>
  <li>Post-Test Questionnaires (1, 2 , 3) </li>
  <li>Demographics  </li>
 </ol>
 
To measure the results, I used the seven-point Likert scale for the first two parts of the questionaire as provuded in the assignment document. 
For the adjective list provided to us, I modified it to not overwhelm the participant. SO it only had 16 adjective: 8 that have negative/poor connotation and 8 that had a positive connotation.

**Results and Final Thoughts**

The partipant did not struggle very much with the tasks. THey told me they could not complete two steps from Task Two but they in fact did complete one of the two. The second tasks asked the user to enlarge the book cover of the bpok they were viewing in hopes htey woudl see how blurry the image is. They were able to enlarge the cover but they did not think they did. So that was my mistake. I should have been more clear. However, for the third step, it asked the user to organize the reviews of the same book so that the only reviews it would show were 3-star reviews. They did not know how to do this step even though they explored the page the best they could have.


As the tasks were being done, I suddenly noticed the mistakes I made with the UT. While I thought I made tasks suitable for the age of the participant, I felt like I should have given directions. While my initial thought was that the freedom in how to do the tasks would be beneficial for my research as well as not put stress on the participant, I felt with clear instructions I could have challenged the participants a bit more since I saw that they were capable of more “difficult” tasks. to the task 


Another thing I should have done was encourage the participant with some more questions. They did not talk much. I also should have done either more tasks or like I mentioned before some more difficult but detailed tasks. I still had some questions. Fortunately, after the test was done the user did ask to complete more tasks to explore the app. I gave them two more: one similar to the review task but they had to actually delete their review. And another one where they had to create another bookshelf. For these two tasks some user issues did appear like they couldn’t remember the name of the book so while they kept typing it out (incorrectly) nothing popped up so they gave up completely. Unfortunately, while this is unofficial results it did allow me to see my mistake in throwing the tasks that were given. This is again all unoffical but I thought Iwould include just to show that mistakes can be shown as soon as after the session is over. And due to these tasks not being included, I did miss out on valuable information.
